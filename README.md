#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of software systems.

Below are some importance of software engineering;

Reliability- It is reliable in the sense that it ensures software performs as expected without bias especially for critical applications like healthcare ,finance.

Efficiency - It helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards.

 Scalability and flexibility - It ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting its performance in anyway.

 Security - This helps implement protection practice like authentication, authorization and encryption to secure users information.
 
  Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering

  Development of programming languages.

  The advent of structured programming.

  The establishment of software engineering

  The rise of agile methodologies.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.        
  -Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
  -Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  -Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  -Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  -Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
  -Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
WATERFALL
This is a sequential approach with distinct phases, flowing downwards like a waterfall.
- There is low flexibility
- Testing is done at end of the development process.
WHILES;
AGILE
Is iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.
- There is high flexibility, adapts of changing requirement.
- Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

 - Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
  - Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
  - Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.
  
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

  - Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
  - Version Control Systems (VCS): Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

 - Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
  - Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
  - Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.

Strategies for Overcoming Challenges: Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

  - Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
  - Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
  - System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
  - Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

Importance of Quality Control: Quality control measures such as code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering refers to crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
VAGUE PROMPT
List examples of bowls.
CLEAR PROMPT
List examples of ceramic bowls.

The improved prompt because adding context helps the AI understand your request better.
